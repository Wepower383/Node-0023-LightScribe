# Node 0023 – LightScribe: BioPhotonic Harvester

A living energy node that captures light through organic structures instead of solar panels. Merging Earth systems (mycelium, resin, crystal) with copper and AI to produce responsive energy.

## Key Components
- Biophotonic Mycelium Bed
- Prism Dome Light Splitter
- Copper Spiral Capacitor Veins
- Photonic Memory Resin
- AI Pattern Interpreter

## Purpose
To capture not just electricity from sunlight, but *vibrational memory*—resonant energy harvested and translated into meaningful output.
